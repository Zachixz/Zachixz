Hello, I'm Zach.
I am a LuA Scripter and can somewhat do Javascript.

I work on roblox executors, minecraft injectors ( including java and bedrock ).
I also 3D model through blender.


I work privately and would prefer not to post my source code to the public unless the person that commissioned it has said to do so.
